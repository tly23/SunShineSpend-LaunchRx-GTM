# SunShineSpend-LaunchRx-GTM

This project is a go-to-market (GTM) analytics practicum focused on identifying where market opportunity exists and how to prioritize expansion decisions using healthcare utilization and spend data.

The work centers on building a data-driven market intelligence pipeline that integrates external data via APIs, stores and aggregates data in BigQuery, and applies Python and SQL analytics to generate geo-level opportunity scores. These insights are designed to support GTM strategy, market prioritization, and launch sequencing decisions for revenue-focused teams.

This repository represents an early-stage implementation and will evolve as the project progresses.
